>> BigO
	time complexity: code1 - 15 sec < code2-60sec, means code1 is better than code2 / different machine time varies / so, we measure in terms of no of operations
	Space complexity: code1 15sec but larger space and code2 60sec lesser space, here code2 is better if we concern about space.

>> omega (best case), theta (avg case), omecron (bigO-worst case)	
	O(1) - const oper even n varies
	O(logn) - 2^3 = 8 / log8=3 / divide two parts
	O(n) - for loop  / O(a+b) - O(a*b) - for different inputs
	O(nlogn) - some sorting algortiums
	O(n2) - nested for loop
  o(2^n) -
  O(n!) -
