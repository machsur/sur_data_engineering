>> What is AI: development of computer systems/ machines that simulates human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
    Self-driving cars, Email Grouping, Recommendation Systems, Play Chess
>> Types of AI:
    Strong AI (General AI): Machine intelligence = Human intelligence
    Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed for a specific task
>>
  Traditional Programming: Based on Rules - IF this THEN do that
  Machine Learning: Learns from examples (instead of rules)
  AI: Full system that mimics human intelligence

>> Creating ML models -steps
  1: Data Ingestion   2: Data Preparation   3: Model Training   4: Model Deployment   5: Model Management

>> Data Types
  Structured Data: organized and easily searchable - Employee table - columns for ID, department, salary
  Unstructured Data: Free-form, lacks a predefined format - customer emails describing issues in their own words, User review on a website
  Labeled data: data tagged with meaning (Tags help ML models learn relationships)
         Images tagged as “cat” or “dog”, Customer reviews labeled: positive, negative, neutral - Used in supervised learning
  Unlabeled data: raw data with no predefined tags (Models must discover patterns without guidance) - 
         Customer reviews, A folder of random photos with no captions or tags  - Used in unsupervised or semi-supervised learning
