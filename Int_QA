1. Why are you looking for a job change?
I have had a great learning experience in my current organization, where I worked extensively on GCP-based data engineering projects and production pipelines.
However, I am now looking for an opportunity where I can take more ownership, work on larger-scale data architectures, and contribute more strategically to business decisions.
I’m particularly interested in roles that challenge me technically and allow me to grow toward a senior data engineering position.

Why do you want to join our company?
I am impressed by your company’s focus on data-driven decision making and scalable cloud solutions.
I see that your organization is investing heavily in data analytics and trying to integrate ML/AI skills, which aligns perfectly with my background.

4. Why should we hire you as a Data Engineer?
I bring 4 years of hands-on experience in building and maintaining scalable data pipelines using GCP services like BigQuery, Cloud Composer, and Cloud Storage.
I have worked on end-to-end data solutions — from ingestion and transformation to optimization and monitoring in production environments.
Additionally, my GCP certifications demonstrate my strong foundation in cloud architecture and best practices.
I focus not only on writing code but also on performance optimization, cost efficiency, and data quality — which are critical for modern data platforms.

2. If business team blames data team for wrong dashboard numbers?

Strong Answer:

I would first avoid reacting defensively and focus on understanding the concern. I would review the data source, transformation logic, and dashboard queries to validate whether the issue is technical or due to a misunderstanding of business logic.
If it’s a data issue, I would fix it quickly and explain the root cause transparently.
If it’s a requirement mismatch, I would clarify definitions and align on metrics with the business team.
My goal would be collaboration and clarity rather than assigning blame.

1. If production pipeline fails at midnight, what will you do?

Strong Answer:

First, I would immediately acknowledge the alert and assess the severity of the issue. I would check logs, monitoring dashboards, and error messages to identify the root cause.
If it’s a quick fix like a configuration or dependency issue, I would resolve it immediately. If it requires deeper investigation, I would trigger a rollback or temporary workaround to minimize business impact.
I would also inform relevant stakeholders about the issue and expected resolution time.
Once resolved, I would conduct a root cause analysis and implement preventive measures such as better monitoring, retries, or alert improvements to avoid recurrence.


3. If client changes requirement at last minute?

Strong Answer:

First, I would assess the impact of the change — whether it affects data models, pipeline logic, timelines, or dependencies.
I would discuss the impact clearly with stakeholders, including timeline adjustments if necessary.
If the change is minor, I would accommodate it quickly.
If it significantly affects delivery, I would propose a phased approach or revised deadline to maintain quality.
I believe flexibility is important, but maintaining realistic expectations is equally critical.
