>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos
  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> Architexture
  Hardware
  Software
  kernel - to connect hardware and software app - middle man
  shell - instructions are given ro kernel by user via shell
  deamons - run in background 

>> deamon files ends with "d" / data files / configuration files

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common
  shell script: file consists series of commands for shell - allow automation, save time, more productive
