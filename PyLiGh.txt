>> BigO
	time complexity: code1 - 15 sec < code2-60sec, means code1 is better than code2 / different machine time varies / so, we measure in terms of no of operations
	Space complexity: code1 15sec but larger space and code2 60sec lesser space, here code2 is better if we concern about space.

>> omega (best case), theta (avg case), omecron (bigO-worst case)	
	O(1) - const oper even n varies
	O(logn) - 2^3 = 8 / log8=3 / divide two parts
	O(n) - for loop
	O(nlogn) - some sorting algortiums
	O(n2) - nested for loop
	for different inputs - O(a+b) - O(a*b)

>> Interpreter: The programme that runs your code.
>> Virtual Environment: Python interpreter + dependencies  - Keeps dependencies isolated from other projects
	python -m venv myenv	/ 	venv\Scripts\activate	/		deactivate	/
>> pip - tool for install python packages
>> pypi - centralized repository for py packages
	pip install <package-name>	/ pip install -r requirements.txt  / 	pip freeze > requirements.txt
>> terminate the python programme  ---> sys.exit()
>> Shebang: #!/usr/bin/python3.5  -  tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the file. 
>> variables, lists, tuple, set, dictionory
>> Datatypes: None, Numeric (int, float, bool, complex), sequence(list, tuple, set, range, string), mapping(dictinory)


>> operators: arthematic: +  comparision: ==   logical: and or not   identify: x is y    membership:  x in y  
>> swap variables
>> user input: input / int / eval / python file.py 6(sys.argv[1]) 2 /
>> if elif else / while loop / for loop / for else / break continue pass /
>> why arrays than lists: Optimized/faster, memory efficient for mathematical operations for numerical data.
   Why NumPy: to work with multi-dimensional arrays 
   why Pandas:  handle tabulaer data - data scientist life easier and effective (Python - Need to write code, Excel - Can not handle large data)
>> functions: positional / keyworded / variable length: def sum(a, *b): / keyword variable length: def person(name, **data) /Global variable & local variable  
   recursion: function calling it self ex: factorial using recurssion
   anonymous function, short, one-line function: lambda -- map, filter, reduce
   List comprehensation: create new list from existiong list or other iterals
>> decorator: adding extra feature to the existing function without touching them.
>> Special variable: __name__ == __main__
>> OOPS: Class, object/instance of class, constructer (__init__), self referring object, 
   variables: instance & class var
   methods: instance & class & static mtd
   inheritance: single level & multi level & multiple,  constructor in inheritance: super().__init__/mtd | MRO
   polymorphisum: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading: NA (achive by a=None), method overriding: child class method overrides parent class mtd 
>> Encaptulation: 
	public variable: can access outside class
	private variable: cannt acces from outside of class
	protected variable: can access from derived class, other not
>> Abstract class & method
>> iterators: 
 
>> Handlling errors: using the try-except block --> any error in the try block, exception will be raised and it caught by except block
   compile time error: Syntatical, Logical error: wrong output - used * instead of +, run time error:  occur while the program is running --- print(5 / 0) 
>> multi threading: You're doing multiple tasks at once — that's what multithreading is in a program.
>> file handling, Comments
>> library (group of packages) --> Package (folder - collection of modules) ---> module (file1.py)
>> Why Logging Instead Print: Levels, Output Options, format, Production-Ready.
>> file operations:
-- Magic/Tunder/double underscore methods: enable you to define the behavour of objects for built-in operations such as arth ope, comp oper, more

>> find student details corresponding to max_marks:    student = [('suresh', 'ong', 85), ('seshu', 'bng', 74), ('naven', 'kk', 40)]
>> Given an array, find the minimum and maximum values:    ans. builtin mtds, sorting, python code
>> Given a string, count the char occurrences of word in a dictionary:    Input: 'aaabbbccddeeeee'
>> Count Vowels from Given words .
>> Remove Duplicates from List. 
>> Reversing a String using an Extended Slicing techniques. -------> builtin / slicing / code
>> Find the highest occurrences of each word from string and sort them in order.
>>  Given a list [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], how can you sum all elements? (Discuss available functions)
>> What is a docstring in Python?  Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.
>> What is pass in Python? When is it used? --> Placeholder for future class/function / It does nothing when executed 
>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions:      print(set(ls1) & set(ls2)) or lss =[item for item in ls1 if item in ls2]
>> What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why? --> lists occupy more memory --> their size and contents can change, more methods


>> find line_count, words, chars in the files
>> Sort a List without using Sort keyword. built-in / bubble sort /
>> Find the pair of numbers in this list whose sum is n no.
>> Read and print values from an Excel file using Pandas.
>> Handle file exceptions (missing or corrupted Excel files) gracefully. no error in try block --> try - else - finally /// error ---> except - finally
>>  What is a constructor? -> is special method (__init__) and automatically called to initilize variables when a new instance of a class is created.
>> Find out common letters between two strings Using Python
>> convert two list into dict: result = dict(zip(keys, values))  	// 	convert dict into tuple:     result = tuple(my_dict.items())
>> FIND MISSING NUMBER IN AN ARRAY IN PYTHON  :  n(n+1)/2 - sum(array_elements)
>> PRINT PATTERNS
>> number is prime or not
>> Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
>> Factorial
>> shallow & deep copy - way to duplicate lists etc - behave diff for nested structures (like lists inside lists) - Affects original & original safe when nested changed
>> List Comprehension: [x for x in ls if x % 3 == 0]  //  ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]  //
   [p['name'] for p in people if p['age'] > 30]      //   unique_words = list({word.lower() for word in "Hello world hello".split()})
>> *args and **kwargs: Allows function to accept any number of positional arguments (tuple) & any number of keyword arguments (dict)
>> array contains duplicates - use for in for (n2, 1) - compare element with previous element (n, n)


===============================================================================================================================================================

>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos:  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common

Here are the Git commands that make up most of my workflow: 

working dir --add---> staging area ---committ---> local repo ---push---> remote repo

git clone: Copy a remote repo to your local machine. 
git pull: Grab and merge the latest remote changes. (git fetch - RR to LR + git merge - LR to WR)

git status`: Get a snapshot of your working directory. 
git log --stat / --oneline /: Dive into commit logs with stats. 
git branch: Display all branches in the repo. 
git checkout -b branch_name : create/change branch name
git merge branch_name : Combine branches seamlessly.
git branch -D branch_name`: Ruthlessly delete a branch. 

git add file_path / . : Stage specific files for commit. 
git commit -m "commit message
git commit -a -m "commit message"`: Commit all tracked changes without running git add. 
git commit --amend -m "Initial commit with additional file": The previous commit now includes style.css and has the new message.
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git : link your local repo to a remote repo. The keyword origin is just a conventional name for the remote.
git push origin branch_name`: Push a branch to the remote repo. 

1. `git diff`: Peek into file changes not staged yet. 
5. `git checkout -b branch_name`: Create and hop onto a new branch. 
6. `git checkout branch_name`: Switch to an existing branch. 
10. `git rebase -i`: Rewrite commit history with interactive rebase. 
14. `git stash`: Temporarily save your changes for later. 
15. `git stash pop`: Reapply stashed changes like a pro. 
16. `git show commit_id`: Uncover details about a specific commit. 
17. `git reset HEAD~1`: Undo the last commit, but keep your local changes. 
18. `git format-patch -1 commit_id`: Create a patch for a particular commit. 
19. `git apply patch_file_name`: Apply changes from a patch file. 
21. `git reset`: Roll back commits by moving the branch pointer. 
22. `git revert`: Undo commits by creating a "rollback" commit. 
23. `git cherry-pick commit_id`: Apply a specific commit's changes onto your branch. 
25. `git reset --hard`: Reset everything to a previous commit, nuking uncommitted changes.
