>> BigO
	time complexity: code1 - 15 sec < code2-60sec, means code1 is better than code2 / different machine time varies / so, we measure in terms of no of operations
	Space complexity: code1 15sec but larger space and code2 60sec lesser space, here code2 is better if we concern about space.

>> omega (best case), theta (avg case), omecron (bigO-worst case)	
	O(1) - const oper even n varies
	O(logn) - 2^3 = 8 / log8=3 / divide two parts
	O(n) - for loop
	O(nlogn) - some sorting algortiums
	O(n2) - nested for loop
	for different inputs - O(a+b) - O(a*b)

Python:
>> Interpreter: The programme that runs your code.
>> Virtual Environment: Python interpreter + dependencies  - Keeps dependencies isolated from other projects
	python -m venv myenv	/ 	venv\Scripts\activate	/	pip install <package-name>	/	deactivate	/
>> pip - tool for install python packages
>> pypi - centralized repository for py packages
>> terminate the python programme  ---> sys.exit()
>> Shebang: #!/usr/bin/python3.5  -  tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the file. 
>> set path in windows: allows to run script from cmd
   hide passwords in Windows and access them securely from Python, you can use environment variables or more secure options like the Windows Credential Manager   
   Config Files: great way to manage settings (API keys,..) separately from your main Python code.
>> variables, lists, tuple, set, dictionory
>> Datatypes: None, Numeric (int, float, bool, complex), sequence(list, tuple, set, range, string), mapping(dictinory)
>> operators: arthematic: +  comparision: ==   logical: and or not   identify: x is y    membership:  x in y  
>> swap variables
>> user input: input / int / eval / python file.py 6(sys.argv[1]) 2 /
>> if elif else / while loop / for loop / for else / break continue pass /
>> why arrays than lists: Optimized/faster, memory efficient for mathematical operations for numerical data.
   Why NumPy: to work with multi-dimensional arrays 
   why Pandas:  handle tabulaer data - data scientist life easier and effective (Python - Need to write code, Excel - Can not handle large data)
>> functions: positional / keyworded / variable length: def sum(a, *b): / keyword variable length: def person(name, **data) /Global variable & local variable  
   recursion: function calling it self ex: factorial using recurssion
   anonymous function, short, one-line function: lambda -- map, filter, reduce
   List comprehensation: create new list from existiong list or other iterals
>> decorator: adding extra feature to the existing function without touching them.
>> Special variable: __name__ == __main__
>> OOPS: Class, object, constructer (__init__), self, variables: instance & class var, metd: instance & class & static mtd,  inner class
   inheritance: single level & multi level & multiple,  constructor in inheritance: super().__init__/mtd | MRO
   polymorphisum: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading: NA (achive by a=None), method overriding: child class method overrides parent class mtd 
>> Encaptulation: 
	public variable: can access outside class
	private variable: cannt acces from outside of class
	protected variable: can access from derived class, other not
>> Abstract class & method
>> iterators: 
 
>> Handlling errors: using the try-except block --> any error in the try block, exception will be raised and it caught by except block
   compile time error: Syntatical, Logical error: wrong output - used * instead of +, run time error:  occur while the program is running --- print(5 / 0) 
>> multi threading: You're doing multiple tasks at once — that's what multithreading is in a program.
>> file handling, Comments
>> library (group of packages) --> Package (folder - collection of modules) ---> module (file1.py)
>> Why Logging Instead Print: Levels, Output Options, format, Production-Ready.
>> file operations:
-- Magic/Tunder/double underscore methods: enable you to define the behavour of objects for built-in operations such as arth ope, comp oper, more

>> What is pass in Python? When is it used? --> Placeholder for future class/function / It does nothing when executed 
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why? --> lists occupy more memory --> their size and contents can change, more methods

>> What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?
>> array contains duplicates - use for in for (n2, 1) - compare element with previous element (n, n)

>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos:  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common
