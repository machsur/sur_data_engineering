>> Architexture of composer: Dags dir in gcs - scheduler will trigger the dags - runs dag on worker nodes - metadata db stores inf0 - Web server (for airflow UI)
>> Advantage of cloud composer:
   | DB -- via python --> datalake (gcs) | --> File coneverter csv to parquet --> tarnsform --> load into BQ |
