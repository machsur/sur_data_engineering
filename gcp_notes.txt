=======================
serverless vs fully-managed vs hybrid:
>> "pay as you use". No traffic, you pay nothing. 
   Ex: Cloud Run, Cloud Function, AppEngine standard, firestore, datastore, dataproc, dataflow, ai-platform 
>> managed but not serverless. 
   You always have a minimal number of VM/node up and you pay for these, traffic or not.           
   However, you have nothing to worry about: patching, updates, networking, backups, HA, redundancy(...) are managed for       you.  
   Ex:like Cloud SQL, BigTable or Spanner, AppEngine flex
>> hybrid product: 
   you pay as you use the processing (BigQuery) or the traffic (Cloud Storage), 
   storage is always billed if you have no traffic.
   ex: Cloud Storage or BigQuery:

===================
>> strong consistency provides an up-to-date view of the database at all times, ensuring correctness in financial trans.
>> Patching in Virtual Machines refers to the process of applying updates or fixes to the software running inside a VM. 
>> Backup: Creating a copy of the database (or VM) at a specific point in time, which can be restored in case of data loss,    corruption, or disaster.
   eX: 
   Store this file in a safe location (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
   In case of failure, restore the database using the backup:
   CRON JOBS TO SCHEDULE
Backup: Think of it as saving your work in a document periodically. If something goes wrong, you can reopen the saved file.
>> Redundancy: Ensuring there are multiple copies or replicas of the database available at all times to handle failures         without downtime.
   eX:
   Load Balancer with Failover:
      Use a load balancer to distribute read requests to the replica VM.
      In case the primary VM fails, the replica becomes the new primary.
Redundancy: It’s like having two identical copies of your document open on two computers. If one crashes, the other is ready to take over.
>> synchronously (real-time) or asynchronously (small delayed manner).

>> Apache Spark - multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node       machines or clusters.

>> Apache Spark is the core distributed data processing engine, suitable for large-scale data workloads, and can be             deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
   Google Cloud Dataproc is a managed service that runs Apache Spark (and other frameworks), making it easier to manage,       scale, and integrate with Google Cloud services.

Dataproc: big data processing
1. enable api 
2. create dataproc cluster on vm/gke.
   cluster type: single node 1m0w, standard for dev team 1m Nw, high availability for prod 3m Nw
   configure nodes
   network

gcloud dataproc clusters create dataprocclu1 --enable-component-gateway --region us-central1 --subnet default --no-address --zone us-central1-a --single-node --master-machine-type n1-standard-4 --master-boot-disk-size 500 --image-version 2.2-debian12 --optional-components JUPYTER --scopes 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform' --project possible-dream-433814-b4

3. validate ssh connectivity to master node vm of dataproc cluster: gcloud ssh cammand helps to copy key on vm and able to       ssh vm (external ip is emphemeral)
   >> establish an SSH connection to a remote server VM instance:
      gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-a" "dataprocclu1-m" --project "possible-dream-433814-b4"
      or
      ssh -i C:\Users\surmacha\.ssh\google_compute_engine surmacha@35.184.234.232

3.1. allocate static ip to it.

4. setup vs code remote window for dataproc vm of master node.
5. copy local files/ gcs blobs into hdfs on dataproc.
6. validate pyspark / spark-shell (spark scala) / spark-sql CLI in dataproc cluster.
7. submit dataproc job using spark sql in UI
8. create dataproc workflow using jobs
   cleanup --> convert json file to parquet for orders/order_items --> compute daily product revenue and save back to gcs.
   >> review the scripts.
   >> apply unit tests/validation in local vs code environment configured with dataproc cluster master node.
   >> use scripts in gcs rather then hdfs (temproray based on cluster)
   >> copy spark-sql scripts to gcs location.
   >> run and validate spark-sql scripts placed in gcs using vs code configured with dataproc master node
   >> limitations of running spark sql scripts using dataproc jobs
         submtting jobs by defining query file in gcs via ui is not working (gcloud cli is working).
         submit jobs using gcloud from external cli but not from vs code dataproc master node
   >> submit spark sql jobs: list spark-sql scripts in gcs and review content then submit job using dataproc gcloud command.
   >> dataproc workflow templates: orchestrated pipeline within gcp dataproc
         UI- create template using jobs defined by query text (query file not working in job) - not use in practical
         gcloud commands (more flexibility than ui):
               1. create dataproc workflow template (gcloud dataproc workflow-templates create ----)
               2. attach workflow template with existing cluster (gcloud dataproc workflow-templates add-cluster-selector---)
               3. add jobs to workflow template (gcloud dataproc workflow-templates add-job ----)
               4. instantiate workflow template (gcloud dataproc workflow-templates instantiate ----)
   >> stop / delete cluster using ui, gcloud

Apache airflow operators guide: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/index.html

-- data pipeline: consists of several tasks or actions
-- airflow: workflows - made of dags - automation - scheduling
-- Cloud composer: full managed apache airflow version in GCP for workflow orchestration.

-- create composer environment: runs on GKE
    enable api
    location
    image version (cloud composer and airflow)
    Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension role to the service account
    enivronment (schedular, triggerrer, web server, worker)
    network

-- setup local vs code env and install required dependcies
    use gcloud commands to intract with cloud composer env
    deploy airflow dag into composer env by placing into gcs dags folder


-- Architexture of composer: Web server (UI) - Dags dir in gcs - each dag associated schedule with it -    
    based on schedule, the Executor/scheduler will trigger the dags - runs on worker 
    - metadata db stores executor, web server info

-- dag constructor/class - with in dag id, default args, keyword args, tasks are created by instntiating operators - it helps to create dag object
    note: multiple dags in one py script / one dag can spans multiple py scripts

| DB -- via python --> datalake (gcs) | --> File coneverter csv to parquet --> tarnsform --> load into BQ |
| py app                             |       dataproc workflow                                            |
|              cloud composer                                                                              |

>> templating in Airflow : use templating to inject dynamic values (like dates and parameters) into your bash commands in Airflow.
  
>> use variables
   
>> Calling bash/py script in different folder / machine by using connections

>> XCom (Cross-communication) - for passing small pieces of data between tasks - making workflows more dynamic and flexible

>> branching -  allows you to control the execution path of a workflow based on certain conditions - BranchPythonOperator 

>> Subdag : consists group of parellel tasks.

>> 
SLA (Service Level Agreement) - 
   - is a time-based contract specifying how long a task or DAG should take to run. 
   - If a task exceeds this time limit, Airflow will trigger an alert to notify that the SLA has been missed.

Apache Airflow with Kubernetes allows for a scalable and flexible infrastructure, integrating the dynamic orchestration power of Airflow with the container management capabilities of Kubernetes. This integration provides benefits like dynamic resource allocation, auto-scaling, and isolated task execution in containers. There are two primary ways Kubernetes can be integrated with Airflow:

   Kubernetes Executor: Airflow tasks are dynamically launched in Kubernetes pods.
   KubernetesPodOperator: Individual tasks are run inside Kubernetes pods, but Airflow is otherwise deployed with a             different executor.

Sensors continuously check (or "poke") to see if a condition has been met. 
   Once the condition is satisfied, the sensor task succeeds, allowing the next task in the workflow to execute. 
   If the condition is not met within the defined timeout period, the sensor fails.

   Types of Sensors
   FileSensor: Waits for a file to appear in a directory.
   ExternalTaskSensor: Waits for another task in a different DAG to complete.
   HttpSensor: Waits for an HTTP endpoint to return a certain response.
   S3/GCSKeySensor: Waits for a file to appear in an S3 bucket.
   TimeSensor: Waits until a specific time of day.

>> Apache Airflow vs beam vs spark
   Airflow: schedule and monitor workflows
   Beam: data processing pipeline (google has cloud dataflow)
   Spark: fast and general processing engine compatible with hadoop eco system. (Dataproc in Google)


=====================
Databricks: big data processing
1. signup for databricks from marketplace to use on GCP. then page redirected to workspaces.
2. create databricks workspace on GCP
   data bricks run on cloud platform and utilizes some resorces from underlying gcp project.
3. open workspace UI and spin up databrick clusters on GCP.(cluster mode, node type, runtime version-scala,spark)
4. getting started with databrick notebook on cluster. (do developement using python code and use magic commands to interact with databricks fs)
5. setup databricks cli/sdk or restApi for clients/servers on winodws.
6. manage databricks clusters/fs/jobs/secreats using cli
7. copy datasets from local dir to dbfs using cli
8. process data in dbfs using spark sql in notebooks
9. spark sql to find daily product revenue from the dbfs files
10. convert csv to parquet with schema using pyspark.

11. overview of databricks workflows
    task1(py) --> task2(databricks app) --> task3a/3b(databricks app)--> task4(db app) --> task5(py app)
               |                    databricks workflow                                 |
    |                               external orchestration (airflow)                                     |
12. Pass arguments to databricks python notebooks/ sql notebooks
13. click on dataflow workflow - create job - under job define several tasks and dependency, also utlize cluster type based 
     task load 
    --> create and run first databricks job.
    --> pass arg at task level / job level.
    --> schedule the db workflow job in Job ui (but usally schedule these jobs using external orchestration i.e. airflow)
14. real time databricks job
    --> cleanup database and datasets. Task1
    --> convert csv to parquet by applying schema. Task2
    --> create spark sql table on top of parquet files. Task3
    --> claucate daily product revenue from sql  tables and write result to target in parquet format. Task4
    --> validata app (tasks) for ELT pipeline using databricks.
    --> build ELT pipeline using databricks job in workflows.
    --> run and review execution elt pipeline using databricks job.

ways to authenticate GCP:
>> Application Default Credentials (ADC) in GCP
   Local: Use gcloud auth application-default login for local development.
   Cloud: Deploy the code to GCP, where ADC will use the default service account.
   gcloud auth application-default login    (Quota project "sur-cloud-fun" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota.)
   gcloud auth application-default print-access-token (to verofy credintial)

   dremel - is compute engine - have root server (co-ordinate mixers & leaf nodes) / mixers (do aggreagtions) / leaf nodes        (read data from storage)
   jupiter- high speed n/w connector - to connect dremel with colossus
   borg - scheduling jobs like run queries

>> 
DDL(Data Definition Language) – define structure/schema of database (Create/alter/drop/truncate)
DML(Data Manipulation Language) – manipulate data (Insert/update/delete/merge)
DQL(Data Query Language) – select 
TCL(Transaction Control Language) – commit transaction and role back in case of any errors
DCL(Data Control Language) – for security and access control 

>> Sql query execution order: From / where / group by / having / select / distinct / order by / limit
select 5 /distict 6 / from table 1 / where 2 / group by 3 / having 4/ order by 7 / limit 8

>> conversion functions:
   The CAST function performs a conversion between compatible data types. 
   If the conversion fails due to data type incompatibility or data loss, the query will fail
   The SAFE_CAST function also performs a conversion between compatible data types, 
   but it handles conversion errors differently. Instead of failing the query, it returns NULL when the conversion cannot    be performed.

>> commenting: -- or # or /* LINES */

>> Create table with metadata from existing table – use where 1 = 2 or false

>>   Permanent table: save query results on BQ storage
   Temporary table/cache – Query results saved on cache and valid for 24 hrs.
   Internal/native table/managed tables: table in BQ storage
   External table: BQ querying data from bigtable, gcs, google drive

>> Time travel concept: Query the state of the table as it was at a specific timestamp

>> Creation of view/materialized view and auth view: efficiently manage and secure your data access in BigQuery
   Create view: virtual tables / view hits base table and display data / frequent updates on base table/ infrequent data       access / 
   Materialized view: data stored on disk / better performance/ frequent access on data / infrequent updates on base table /
   Authorized views and authorized materialized views: let you share query results with particular users and groups without    giving them access to the underlying source data.

>> Partitioning and clustering:
   Improved Query Performance: By scanning only relevant partitions and clustered blocks, queries run faster.
   Cost Efficiency: Reduced data scanned means lower costs, as BigQuery charges based on the amount of data processed.

>> Joins: -  combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   INNER JOIN / left join / right join / full join / cross join / self join /
   Best Practices for Joins in BigQuery: Use Appropriate Join Types: / Filter Early / Avoid Cross Joins When Possible / 
   Use Partitioned and Clustered Tables: If joining large tables / Monitor Query Performance /

>> With statement: also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), allows you to define temporary result sets.
   Adv: code more readable, resusebility - referenced in several places within the main SQL query. 

>> Conditions:
If condition
then
sql statement;
end if;

for var in list
do 
sql statement;
end for;

/ labels /repeat / while /leave/ break/ continue/ iterate 

>> Pivoting and unpivoting: help in reshaping your data for analysis or reporting
   Pivot: row into columns
   unpivot: columns into rows

>> Normalization – avoid redundant data (lesser storage costs)- poor query performance (joining tables)
   De Normalization – redundant data (high storage cost) – better Query performance 
   Why array & structs? – for better query per and lesser storage costs
   
   Arrays – list of items having same data type
   SELECT element FROM mydataset.mytable, UNNEST(my_array) AS element;

   Struct – record with nested fields having different data types
   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM mydataset.mytable;
 
>> Window functions: performing advanced calculations over a set of rows, go beyond simple aggregates or filters
   max(cn) / min(cn) / count(cn) / sum(cn) / avg(cn) /row_number() / rank() / dense_rank() 
   SUM(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rt
   lag(cn) / lead(cn): Accesses data from a previous or subsequent row in the same result set without use of a self-join.
   LAG(column2, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS previous_value,
   first_value(cn) / last_value(cn) / nth_value(cn, n) 
   FIRST_VALUE(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS first_value,
   ntile(n) – n groups 
   NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS quartile
   cum_dist() / percent_rank() 
   Rows consider current row even if duplicates / range considers bottom row of duplicates.

>> Regular expressions: used for pattern matching and string manipulation
   REGEXP_CONTAINS(column_name, r'pattern')
   REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(column_name, r'pattern')
   REGEXP_REPLACE(column_name, r'pattern', 'replacement')
   SPLIT(column_name, r'pattern')

>> Big Query cost optimization
   -- bq compute optimization: on-demaned analysis, bq editions - decide based on your workloads.
