========
why PySpark not python for bigdata? :
python - take sample of data and apply statistics to develop histograms
pyrhon - can process large datasets with multithreads 
problem - when data is big and stays in memory / we cant take entire data on compute and use python on it.
        - data cant stay in one computer and it can be distributed.
=========
Apache spark:
- opensource distributed processing system for big data.
- in-memory caching
- uses optimized query execution for fast queries
- provides api in java, scala, python, r
- supports batch processing, inetractive queries, real-time analytics, ml and graph processing
