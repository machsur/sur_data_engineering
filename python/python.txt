====================================>> concepts

>> Interpreter: The programme that runs your code.
   Virtual Environment: Python interpreter + dependencies  - python -m venv myenv	/ 	activate	/	deactivate	/
   pip - tool for install python packages
   pypi - centralized repository for py packages:	pip install <package-name>	/ pip install -r requirements.txt  / 	pip freeze > requirements.txt
   terminate the python programme  ---> sys.exit()
   Shebang: #!/usr/bin/python3.5  -  tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the file. 

>> Datatypes: 
None: declare a variable first, assign later - function that returns nothing actually returns None
Numeric: int (5), float (7.0), bool (true), complex (2 + 4j)
sequence:
	range:
	string:
	list: 		ordered, 	changeble, 		duplicates
	tuple:		ordered, 	no change, 		duplicates
	set:		unorder, 	changeble, 		no duplicates
mapping:
	dictinory:  ordered,	changble,		no duplicate keys
 iterator types:
	iterator - Stores no data → produces one element on the fly (lazy evaluation) - cant be indexed - Exhaust after use
	Generators gives iterators using yield - ideal for reading large files line-by-line, 

>> if elif else / while loop / for loop / for else / break continue pass /

>> functions: positional / keyworded / default / variable length: def sum(a, *b): / keyword variable length: def person(name, **data) /Global variable & local variable  
   recursion: function calling it self ex: factorial using recurssion
   anonymous function, short, one-line function: lambda -- map, filter, reduce
   List comprehensation: create new list from existiong list or other iterals
		[new_item for item in iterable]
		[new_item for item in iterable if condition]
		[expr_if_true if condition else expr_if_false for item in iterable]

>> why arrays than lists: Optimized/faster, memory efficient for mathematical operations for numerical data.
   Why NumPy: to work with multi-dimensional arrays 
   why Pandas:  handle tabulaer data - data scientist life easier and effective (Python - Need to write code, Excel - Can not handle large data)

>> 
OOPS: Class, object/instance of class, constructer (__init__), self referring object, 
variables: instance & class var
methods: instance & class & static mtd
inheritance: single level & multi level & multiple,  constructor in inheritance: super().__init__/mtd | MRO
polymorphisum: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading: NA (achive by a=None), method overriding: child class method overrides parent class mtd 
Encaptulation: 
	public variable: can access outside class
	private variable: cannt acces from outside of class
	protected variable: can access from derived class, other not
Abstract class & method
decorator: adding extra feature to the existing function without touching them.

>> Handlling errors: using the try-except block --> any error in the try block, exception will be raised and it caught by except block
   compile time error: Syntatical, Logical error: wrong output - used * instead of +, run time error:  occur while the program is running --- print(5 / 0) 
>> multi threading: You're doing multiple tasks at once — that's what multithreading is in a program.
>>  
module (file1.py - collection of functions) 
Package (folder - collection of modules)  - init file, file1.py, file2.py, ... 
library (collection of packages)  - ex: numpy, pandas
framework: collection of libraries with architexture - MVC & MVT archi - Model View Controller Template
>> Why Logging Instead Print: Levels, Output Options, format, Production-Ready.
logging.basicConfig(filename='sur.log', filemode='a', 
                    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(filename)s %(lineno)d %(message)s",
                    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
                    style="%",
                    level=logging.INFO)
>> file operations:
-- Magic/Tunder/double underscore methods: enable you to define the behavour of objects for built-in operations such as arth ope, comp oper, more

=============================>> QA

>> Generate an Infinite Fibonacci Series Using a Generator. 
>> Sort a List Without Using the sort Keyword
>> Check Whether a String is a Palindrome or Not
>> Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number.
>> Frequency of Words in a Sentence
>> Find the Smallest and Largest Number in an Array
>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions:      print(set(ls1) & set(ls2)) or lss =[item for item in ls1 if item in ls2]
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why? --> lists occupy more memory --> their size and contents can change, more methods
>> List Comprehension: [x for x in ls if x % 3 == 0]  //  ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]  //
>>  What is a constructor? -> is special method (__init__) and automatically called to initilize variables when a new instance of a class is created.
>> Find out common letters between two strings Using Python
>> convert two list into dict: result = dict(zip(keys, values))  	// 	convert dict into tuple:     result = tuple(my_dict.items())
>> *args and **kwargs: Allows function to accept any number of positional arguments (tuple) & any number of keyword arguments (dict)
>> number is prime or not
>> find line_count, words, chars in the files
>> Find the pair of numbers in this list whose sum is n no.

>> Sort a List without using Sort keyword. built-in / bubble sort /
	bubble sort: keep largest item at the end (6 items- 5comp in 1st round) 
	selection sort: find min_index corresponding to lowest value and swap values
	insertion sort: start at 2 element and compare previous elements (for almost sorted lists - o(n) not n2)

>> shallow: Only top-level duplicated, inner elements shared
   deep copy: [[A'], [B]] are independent clones - original is safe

>> Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: s = "abcabdbcefb" 

>> Explanation: The longest consecutive is [1, 2, 3, 4] which have a length of 4
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4

>>
Given a string, reverse only the vowels while keeping other characters in the same position.
Example: Input: "hello world", Output: "holle werld"
