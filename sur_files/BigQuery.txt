>> Bigquery arch: storage and compute - decoupled/isolated (cost efficient)
   colossus - distributed file system storage layer in column orientaed - fault tolerance by data replicas across different machines.
   dremel - is compute engine - have root server (co-ordinate mixers & leaf nodes) / mixers (do aggreagtions) / leaf nodes (read data from storage)
   jupiter- high speed n/w connector - to connect dremel with colossus;    borg - scheduling jobs like run queries
>> Fact Table: Contains numeric values (quantitative data - sales, revenue, profit, etc), foreign keys, Grows rapidly
   Dimension Table: contains textual or categorical data, smaller and changes less frequently.
>> Star Schema: Multiple Dimension Tables directly connected to the fact table
   Snowflake Schema: Dimension tables are split into sub-dimensions, reducing redundancy, more normalized form. 
>> Change Data Capture -->> identify & capture changes made to data in DB --> log based - very efficient, query based on timestamp, triggers load changes into new tables
>> SCD0 - NO CHANGE - change in source, no update on DWH table - change column is not relavant to the DWH table anymore (ex: fax number)	
   SCD1 - Overwrite - Updates the existing record with new data - No history is preserved.
   SCD2 - Add New Row  -- Keeps full history by adding a new row with versioning or effective dates.
   SCD3 - Add New Column -- Keeps limited history by adding a new column for the previous value | SCD4 - scd1+scd2 - Current Table & History Table
>> to get expensive queries, metadata about datasets:  SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`region-europe-west2`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA..JOBS/SCHEMATA;
   to get metadata about tables/columns: SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`dataset_id`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES/.COLUMNS;
>> difference b/w CAST, SAFE_CAST : If the conversion fails, SAFE_CAST returns NULL instead of throwing an error, allowing the query to continue.
>> Union all / Union distinct  / Except distinct / Intersect distinct / Table wildcards: test_*` where _Table_Suffix > 5
>> Temporary table - intermediate data proce and caching | Internal table- freq accessed and processed data | External table - for occasional queries on large datasets.
>> Time travel concept: SELECT * FROM `your_dataset.your_table`	FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
>> view, materialized view and auth view (share results without giving access to source data): efficiently manage and secure your data access in BigQuery
>> Partitioning (single column, 4000 max) and clustering (sorts parti data in storage blocks, four col): Improved Query Performance, Cost Efficiency
>> Joins: - INNER JOIN / left join / right join / full join / cross join /
>> Pivot: row into columns 	- product| month| sales  	- select * from table pivot(sum(sales) for month in ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar')); --> or use case statement
   unpivot: columns into rows 	- product | Jan | Feb | Mar	- select product, month, sales from table unpivot(sales for month in (Jan, Feb, Mar));
>>  Normalization – avoid redundant data, poor query performance |  De Normalization – redundant data (high storage cost) – better Query performance 
    Why array & structs? – for better query per and lesser storage costs
    Arrays – list of items having same data type  -  SELECT element FROM mydataset.mytable, UNNEST(my_array) AS element; 
    Struct – record with nested fields having different data types  -   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM mydataset.mytable;



>> bq slots: units of computational capacity -CPU and memory, Reservations: allow you to purchase dedicated slots (called commitments) 
>> Big Query cost optimization
   bq compute optimization: on-demaned pricing, Capacity Pricing (slots reserve)
   BQ data storage: Billing model: logical/physical, Use Table Expiration, Use Long-Term Storage Pricing (> 90 days)
   query Opti: Agg at Source,  use avro, dataset at cust loc, Parti & Clust, preview, select col, use trun, Join, where, late agg, Caching, mat view for freq queries
>> Cost Controls: budget alerts, Set query usage limits, export Billing reports, Schedule queries during off-peak hours
