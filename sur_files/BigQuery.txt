>> Bigquery arch
   storage and compute - decoupled/isolated (cost efficient)
   layers:
   colossus - is google distributed file system storage layer in column orientaed - fault tolerance by data replicas across different machines.
   dremel - is compute engine - have root server (co-ordinate mixers & leaf nodes) / mixers (do aggreagtions) / leaf nodes (read data from storage)
   jupiter- high speed n/w connector - to connect dremel with colossus
   borg - scheduling jobs like run queries

>>  
Fact Table
Contains numeric values (quantitative data ) (facts) like sales, revenue, profit, etc.
Has foreign keys referencing dimension tables.
Grows rapidly as new transactions are added.
Date_ID	Product_ID	Store_ID	Sales_Amount	Quantity_Sold
20250601		101		1		5000

Dimension Table
A Dimension Table contains descriptive attributes or textual or categorical data.
Typically smaller and changes less frequently.
Product_ID	Product_Name	Category	Brand
101		Laptop		Electronics	Dell

>>
Star Schema: Multiple Dimension Tables directly connected to the fact table
Snowflake Schema: is a more normalized form of the star schema. Dimension tables are split into sub-dimensions, reducing redundancy.

>> SCD: dimensions that change over time
	SCD0 - NO CHANGE - change in source, no update on DWH table - change column is not relavant to the DWH table anymore (ex: fax number)	
	SCD1 - Overwrite -Updates the existing record with new data - No history is preserved.
	SCD2 - Add New Row  -- Keeps full history by adding a new row with versioning or effective dates.
	SCD3 - Add New Column -- Keeps limited history by adding a new column for the previous value.
	SCD4 - scd1+scd2 - Current Table: Stores only the latest data. & History Table: Stores all historical changes with timestamps or versioning.
	scd6 - 1+2+3 - 

>> "write a query to how will you get a list of the top ten most expensive queries that have been executed in your project over the past 30 days:"
	SELECT * FROM `region-eu`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS WHERE creation_time between TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
	to get metadata about datasets:  SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`region-europe-west2`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
	to get metadata about tables: SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`dataset_id`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
	to get metadata about columns: SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`dataset_id`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS;

>> difference b/w CAST, SAFE_CAST : If the conversion fails, SAFE_CAST returns NULL instead of throwing an error, allowing the query to continue.

>> Union all / Union distinct / Table wildcards: test_*` where _Table_Suffix > 5 / Except distinct / Intersect distinct /

>> 	Temporary table/cache: exist only for the specified period. - useful for intermediate data processing and caching query results.
	Internal tables: stored in bq - take adv of opti like partitioning & clustering - Ideal for frequently accessed and processed data.
	External table: Data remains in its original location (e.g., Cloud Storage) - avoid storage costs - Suitable for occasional queries on large datasets.

>> Time travel concept: Query the state of the table as it was at a specific timestamp
	create table `your_dataset.your_table11` as
	SELECT * FROM `your_dataset.your_table`	FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)

>> Creation of view/materialized view and auth view: efficiently manage and secure your data access in BigQuery
   Create view: virtual tables / view hits base table and display data / frequent updates on base table/ infrequent data access / 
   Materialized view: data stored on disk / better performance/ frequent access on data / infrequent updates on base table /
   Authorized views and authorized materialized views: let you share query results with particular users and groups withoutgiving them access to the underlying source data.

>> Partitioning and clustering:    Improved Query Performance, Cost Efficiency
   Partitioning: dividing a table into smaller segments. - single column (time-based & inter range), 4000 max
   clustering: sorts the partition data in storage blocks. - four columns, 
	CREATE TABLE `your_dataset.your_table`
      	PARTITION BY DATE(order_date) / _PARTITIONTIME / RANGE_BUCKET(product_id, GENERATE_ARRAY(1, 1000, 100))
      	CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id
      	AS SELECT * FROM `source_dataset.source_table`

>> Joins: -  combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
    INNER JOIN / left join / right join / full join / cross join /
 
>> Pivoting and unpivoting: help in reshaping your data for analysis or reporting
   Pivot: row into columns 	- product| month| sales  	- select * from table pivot(sum(sales) for month in ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar'));	 	- or use case st
   unpivot: columns into rows 	- product | Jan | Feb | Mar	- select product, month, sales from table unpivot(sales for month in (Jan, Feb, Mar));

>>  Normalization – avoid redundant data (lesser storage costs)- poor query performance (joining tables)
    De Normalization – redundant data (high storage cost) – better Query performance 
    Why array & structs? – for better query per and lesser storage costs
    Arrays – list of items having same data type  -  SELECT element FROM mydataset.mytable, UNNEST(my_array) AS element; 
    Struct – record with nested fields having different data types  -   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM mydataset.mytable;
 
>> Window functions: performing advanced calculations over a set of rows, go beyond simple aggregates or filters
   max(cn) / min(cn) / count(cn) / sum(cn) / avg(cn) /row_number() / rank() / dense_rank() /  lag(cn) / lead(cn) /   first_value(cn) / last_value(cn) / nth_value(cn, n) /
   SUM(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED/2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rt
   ntile(n) – n groups 
   CUME_DIST() = Number of rows with values less than or equal to the current row / Total number of rows
​   PERCENT_RANK() = Rank of current row−1 / Total rows−1
​   Rows consider current row even if duplicates / range considers bottom row of duplicates.

>> BigQuery slots vs reservations? 
	Slots are units of computational capacity in BigQuery. (CPU and memory)
	Reservations allow you to purchase dedicated slots (called commitments) and allocate them to specific workloads or projects.

>> Big Query cost optimization
	   -- bq compute optimization: 
		on-demaned pricing - cost per tb, good for unpredectable workloads
		Capacity Pricing - purchase dedicated slots, charged per slot-hour (different editions like Enterprise and Enterprise Plus, which offer options for one- or 		three-year commitments at discounted rates)- decide based on your workloads.
	   -- BQ data storage – 
		Billing model: logical- data in uncompressed format/ physical- data in compressed format) 
	         # For logical bytes billing:   bq update --dataset --storage_billing_model=LOGICAL my_dataset
	         # For physical bytes billing:  bq update --dataset --storage_billing_model=PHYSICAL my_dataset
	   	Use Table Expiration Settings, Optimize Data Storage Format (cloumner format - paqruet. ORC), Use Long-Term Storage Pricing (> 90 days)
	   -- bq query optimization

>> Optimization of query performance in BigQuery?
	Aggregate Data at the Source,  use avro format - for quick data load, 
	dataset in wehere customer operates, 
	Partitioned Tables and Clustered,  preview option, select columns instead of *, use truncate instead of delete
	Join pattern larger table join smaller tables, where class first condition in such way that eliminates most data,   late aggregation, 	   
	Use WITH Clauses for Subquery Caching (Avoid Repeated Scalar Subqueries),  Take Advantage of Query Caching, 
	Create a materialized view based on frequently run queries.
	nest repeated data, Denormalize Data Where Appropriate (Use ARRAY Functions for Multi-Value Fields)
  
>> Cost Controls: budget alerts, Set query usage limits in IAM quotas, Billing reports, Schedule queries during off-peak hours

>> Database, DWH, DataLake

>> ETL VS ELT

>> Subquery, cte
   
>> Change Data Capture (CDC) -->> identify and capture changes made to data in a database 
      log based --> very efficient, no impact on source system
      query based on timestamp
      triggers load changes into new tables
