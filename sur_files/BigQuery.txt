===================

BIGQUERY:

>> Bigquery arch
   storage and compute - decoupled/isolated (cost efficient)
   layers:
   colossus - is google distributed file system storage layer in column orientaed - fault tolerance by data replicas across different machines.
   dremel - is compute engine - have root server (co-ordinate mixers & leaf nodes) / mixers (do aggreagtions) / leaf nodes (read data from storage)
   jupiter- high speed n/w connector - to connect dremel with colossus
   borg - scheduling jobs like run queries

>> Sql query execution order: From / where / group by / having / select / distinct / order by / limit
select 5 /distict 6 / from table 1 / where 2 / group by 3 / having 4/ order by 7 / limit 8

>> conversion functions:
   The CAST function performs a conversion between compatible data types. 
   If the conversion fails due to data type incompatibility or data loss, the query will fail
   The SAFE_CAST function also performs a conversion between compatible data types, 
   but it handles conversion errors differently. Instead of failing the query, it returns NULL when the conversion cannot    be performed.

>> commenting: -- or # or /* LINES */

>> Create table with metadata from existing table – use where 1 = 2 or false

>> .
   SELECT * EXCEPT(column1, column2, ...) FROM table_name; 
   SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees limit 10;
   SELECT ROUND(56.14159, -2/-1); / SELECT ROUND(56.14159, 2); /

>> String functions:
concat, length, repeat, reverse, replace, upper, lower, ltrim, rtrim, trim, left, right, substr, starts_with, ends_with, contains_substr, strpos, instr
CONCAT('#', LTRIM('   apple   '), '#') / LENGTH('suresh') / SPLIT('apple,banana,orange', ',') / REPEAT('abc', 3) / REVERSE('abc') / REPLACE ('desert pie', 'pie', 'cobbler') 
LEFT('banana', 3) / RIGHT('apple', 3) / SUBSTR('apple', 2, 2) / SUBSTRING alias for SUBSTR /
LOWER('FOO BAR BAZ') / UPPER('foo')
LTRIM('   apple   ') / RTRIM('***apple***', '*') / TRIM( '   apple   ') /
STARTS_WITH('bar', 'b') / ENDS_WITH('apple', 'e') / CONTAINS_SUBSTR('the blue house', CONCAT('Blue ', 'house')) / 
INSTR('banana', 'an', 1, 1) or INSTR(string, substring, start_position, occurrence) / STRPOS('foo@example.com', '@') 

>> Union all / Union distinct / Table wildcards: test_*` where _Table_Suffix > 5 / Except distinct / Intersect distinct /

>>   Permanent table: save query results on BQ storage
   Temporary table/cache – Query results saved on cache and valid for 24 hrs.
   Internal/native table/managed tables: table in BQ storage
   External table: BQ querying data from bigtable, gcs, google drive

>> Time travel concept: Query the state of the table as it was at a specific timestamp
      SELECT * FROM `your_dataset.your_table`
      FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)

>> Creation of view/materialized view and auth view: efficiently manage and secure your data access in BigQuery
   Create view: virtual tables / view hits base table and display data / frequent updates on base table/ infrequent data       access / 
   Materialized view: data stored on disk / better performance/ frequent access on data / infrequent updates on base table /
   Authorized views and authorized materialized views: let you share query results with particular users and groups without    giving them access to the underlying source data.
         CREATE VIEW `your_dataset.your_view` AS
         SELECT
           customer_id,
           order_date,
           total_amount
         FROM
           `your_dataset.orders`
         WHERE
           order_date >= '2025-01-01'

            CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `your_dataset.your_materialized_view` AS
            SELECT
              customer_id,
              order_date,
              SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
            FROM
              `your_dataset.orders`
            GROUP BY
              customer_id, order_date

>> Partitioning and clustering:
   Improved Query Performance: By scanning only relevant partitions and clustered blocks, queries run faster.
   Cost Efficiency: Reduced data scanned means lower costs, as BigQuery charges based on the amount of data processed.
      CREATE TABLE `your_dataset.your_table`
      PARTITION BY DATE(order_date)
      CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id
      AS
      SELECT * FROM `source_dataset.source_table`

>> Joins: -  combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   INNER JOIN / left join / right join / full join / cross join / self join /
   Best Practices for Joins in BigQuery: Use Appropriate Join Types: / Filter Early / Avoid Cross Joins When Possible / 
   Use Partitioned and Clustered Tables: If joining large tables / Monitor Query Performance /

>> With statement: also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), allows you to define temporary result sets.
   Adv: code more readable, resusebility - referenced in several places within the main SQL query. 

>> Conditions:
If condition
then
sql statement;
end if;

for var in list
do 
sql statement;
end for;

/ labels /repeat / while /leave/ break/ continue/ iterate 

>> Pivoting and unpivoting: help in reshaping your data for analysis or reporting
   Pivot: row into columns
   unpivot: columns into rows

>> Normalization – avoid redundant data (lesser storage costs)- poor query performance (joining tables)
   De Normalization – redundant data (high storage cost) – better Query performance 
   Why array & structs? – for better query per and lesser storage costs
   
   Arrays – list of items having same data type
   SELECT element FROM mydataset.mytable, UNNEST(my_array) AS element;

   Struct – record with nested fields having different data types
   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM mydataset.mytable;
 
>> Window functions: performing advanced calculations over a set of rows, go beyond simple aggregates or filters
   max(cn) / min(cn) / count(cn) / sum(cn) / avg(cn) /row_number() / rank() / dense_rank() 
   SUM(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED/2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rt
   lag(cn) / lead(cn): Accesses data from a previous or subsequent row in the same result set without use of a self-join.
   LAG(column2, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS previous_value,
   first_value(cn) / last_value(cn) / nth_value(cn, n) 
   FIRST_VALUE(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS first_value,
   ntile(n) – n groups 
   NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS quartile
   cum_dist() / percent_rank() 
   CUME_DIST= Number of rows with values less than or equal to the current row / Total number of rows
​   PERCENT_RANK= Rank of current row−1 / Total rows−1
​   Rows consider current row even if duplicates / range considers bottom row of duplicates.

>> Regular expressions: used for pattern matching and string manipulation
   REGEXP_CONTAINS(column_name, r'pattern')
   REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(column_name, r'pattern')
   REGEXP_REPLACE(column_name, r'pattern', 'replacement')
   SPLIT(column_name, r'pattern') --> select  SPLIT("mach suresh", ' ')[OFFSET(0)] AS first_name,

>> Big Query cost optimization
   -- bq compute optimization: on-demaned analysis, bq editions - decide based on your workloads.
   
   -- BQ data storage – 
   Billing model: logical- data in uncompressed format/ physical- data in compressed format) 
   Use Table Expiration Settings 
   Optimize Data Storage Format (cloumner format - paqruet. ORC)
   Use Long-Term Storage Pricing (> 90 days)

   -- Query optimization 
   create dataset in region wehere customer operates
   Use Partitioned Tables and Clustered Tables
   use avro format to bigquery data load - google rec compressed avro for quick data load
   use preview option for bq native table
   select columns instead of *
   use truncate instead of delete
   nest repeated data, Denormalize Data Where Appropriate (Use ARRAY Functions for Multi-Value Fields)
   Join pattern larger table join smaller tables, Optimize JOIN Operations, avoid cross join
   where class first condition in such way that eliminates most data
   late aggregation
   Use WITH Clauses for Subquery Caching (Avoid Repeated Scalar Subqueries)
   Take Advantage of Query Caching
   Aggregate Data at the Source: Use Approximate Aggregations: 
   Create a materialized view based on frequently run queries.
   Optimize Window Functions
   Monitor and Tune Query Performance
  
   -- Cost Controls: 
   Set quotas and budget alerts
   set query limits
   Analyze Cost Breakdown Using Cloud Billing Reports
   Schedule queries during off-peak hours to take advantage of low on-demand pricing typically at mid-night/early morning

>> Find the 777th highest salary from a table.
      SELECT salary
      FROM (
        SELECT salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
        FROM `your_dataset.your_table`
      )
      WHERE row_num = 777

>> Identify customers who placed orders in consecutive months.
         WITH orders AS (
           SELECT
             customer_id,
             DATE_TRUNC(order_date, MONTH) AS order_month
           FROM
             `your_dataset.your_table`
         ),
         consecutive_orders AS (
           SELECT
             customer_id,
             order_month,
             LEAD(order_month) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_month) AS next_order_month
           FROM
             orders
         )
         SELECT
           customer_id,
           order_month,
           next_order_month
         FROM
           consecutive_orders
         WHERE
           DATE_DIFF(next_order_month, order_month, MONTH) = 1

>> Query to get the total number of patients per doctor, including unassigned patients.
         SELECT
           d.doctor_id,
           COUNT(p.patient_id) AS total_patients
         FROM
           `your_dataset.doctors` d
         LEFT JOIN
           `your_dataset.patients` p
         ON
           d.doctor_id = p.doctor_id
         GROUP BY
           d.doctor_id

>> Handling NULL values in employee salary using the average salary.
    IFNULL(expression, replacement_value) -->> It takes two arguments. If the first argument is NULL, it returns the second argument.
    COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN) -->> It can take multiple arguments. It returns the first non-NULL argument from the list.
         WITH avg_salary AS (
           SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary
           FROM `your_dataset.your_table`
         )

           employee_id,
           COALESCE(salary, (SELECT average_salary FROM avg_salary)) AS adjusted_salary
         FROM
           `your_dataset.your_table`

>> Difference between Subquery and Materialized Views.
    Performance: Materialized views can improve query performance by storing precomputed results, while subqueries are recalculated each time the main query runs.
    Storage: Materialized views consume storage space to store the precomputed results, whereas subqueries do not.
    Maintenance: Materialized views need to be refreshed to stay up-to-date with the underlying data, while subqueries always reflect the current state of the data.

>> CTE vs Subquery in SQL and their performance impact.
    Readability and Maintainability:
    Optimization: Subquery Treated similarly to CTEs in terms of optimization. The query optimizer will attempt to optimize the entire query, including the subqueries.
    Reusability:

>> Steps to debug a slow SQL query.

>> Change Data Capture (CDC) -->> identify and capture changes made to data in a database --> It helps keep track of inserts, updates, and deletes in real-time.
      Benefits:
      Real-time updates: Ensures data consistency across systems.
      Efficiency: Reduces the need for full data scans.
      Accuracy: Minimizes errors by capturing changes as they happen.
      how to implement:
      log based --> very efficient, no impact on source system
      query based on timestamp
      triggers load changes into new tables
