===================

1. "write a query to how will you get a list of the top ten most expensive queries that have been executed in your project over the past 30 days:"
	SELECT project_id, job_id, user_email, creation_time, total_slot_ms, total_bytes_billed, total_bytes_processed, query FROM `region-eu`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS
	WHERE creation_time between TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
	      AND job_type = "QUERY"
	      AND total_bytes_processed > 0
	ORDER BY total_bytes_billed DESC LIMIT 10;

2. difference b/w CAST, SAFE_CAST 
	If the conversion fails, SAFE_CAST returns NULL instead of throwing an error, allowing the query to continue.

3. Create table with metadata from existing table – use where 1 = 2 or false

4. Union all / Union distinct / Table wildcards: test_*` where _Table_Suffix > 5 / Except distinct / Intersect distinct /

5. Permanent table, Temporary table/cache, Internal/native table/managed tables, External table

6. Time travel concept: Query the state of the table as it was at a specific timestamp
      SELECT * FROM `your_dataset.your_table`
      FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)

7. Creation of view/materialized view and auth view: efficiently manage and secure your data access in BigQuery
   Create view: virtual tables / view hits base table and display data / frequent updates on base table/ infrequent data access / 
   Materialized view: data stored on disk / better performance/ frequent access on data / infrequent updates on base table /
   Authorized views and authorized materialized views: let you share query results with particular users and groups withoutgiving them access to the underlying source data.
         CREATE VIEW `your_dataset.your_view` AS
         SELECT customer_id, order_date, total_amount FROM `your_dataset.orders` WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'

        CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `your_dataset.your_materialized_view` AS
        SELECT customer_id, order_date, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent FROM `your_dataset.orders` GROUP BY customer_id, order_date

8. Partitioning and clustering:
   Partitioning: single column (time-based & inter range), 4000 max
   clustering: four columns, 
   Improved Query Performance: By scanning only relevant partitions and clustered blocks, queries run faster.
   Cost Efficiency: Reduced data scanned means lower costs, as BigQuery charges based on the amount of data processed.
      CREATE TABLE `your_dataset.your_table`
      PARTITION BY DATE(order_date) / _PARTITIONTIME / RANGE_BUCKET(product_id, GENERATE_ARRAY(1, 1000, 100))
      CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id
      AS
      SELECT * FROM `source_dataset.source_table`

9. Joins: -  combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
   INNER JOIN / left join / right join / full join / cross join / self join /
   Best Practices for Joins in BigQuery: Use Appropriate Join Types: / Filter Early / Avoid Cross Joins When Possible / 
   Use Partitioned and Clustered Tables: If joining large tables / Monitor Query Performance /

10. With statement: also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), allows you to define temporary result sets.
   Adv: code more readable, resusebility - referenced in several places within the main SQL query. 

11. Pivoting and unpivoting: help in reshaping your data for analysis or reporting
   Pivot: row into columns
   unpivot: columns into rows

12. Normalization – avoid redundant data (lesser storage costs)- poor query performance (joining tables)
   De Normalization – redundant data (high storage cost) – better Query performance 
   Why array & structs? – for better query per and lesser storage costs
   
   Arrays – list of items having same data type
   SELECT element FROM mydataset.mytable, UNNEST(my_array) AS element;

   Struct – record with nested fields having different data types
   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM mydataset.mytable;
 
13. Window functions: performing advanced calculations over a set of rows, go beyond simple aggregates or filters
   max(cn) / min(cn) / count(cn) / sum(cn) / avg(cn) /row_number() / rank() / dense_rank() 
   SUM(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED/2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rt
   lag(cn) / lead(cn): Accesses data from a previous or subsequent row in the same result set without use of a self-join.
   LAG(column2, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS previous_value,
   first_value(cn) / last_value(cn) / nth_value(cn, n) 
   FIRST_VALUE(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS first_value,
   ntile(n) – n groups 
   NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS quartile
   cum_dist() / percent_rank() 
   CUME_DIST= Number of rows with values less than or equal to the current row / Total number of rows
​   PERCENT_RANK= Rank of current row−1 / Total rows−1
​   Rows consider current row even if duplicates / range considers bottom row of duplicates.

14. Regular expressions: used for pattern matching and string manipulation
	   REGEXP_CONTAINS(column_name, r'pattern')
	   REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL(column_name, r'pattern')
	   REGEXP_REPLACE(column_name, r'pattern', 'replacement')
	   SPLIT(column_name, r'pattern') --> select  SPLIT("mach suresh", ' ')[OFFSET(0)] AS first_name,

15. BigQuery slots vs reservations? 
	Slots are units of computational capacity in BigQuery. (CPU and memory)
	Reservations allow you to purchase dedicated slots (called commitments) and allocate them to specific workloads or projects.

15.1. Big Query cost optimization
	   -- bq compute optimization: 
		on-demaned pricing - cost per tb, good for unpredectable workloads
		Capacity Pricing - purchase dedicated slots, charged per slot-hour (different editions like Enterprise and Enterprise Plus, which offer options for one- or 		three-year commitments at discounted rates)- decide based on your workloads.
	   -- BQ data storage – 
		Billing model: logical- data in uncompressed format/ physical- data in compressed format) 
	         # For logical bytes billing:   bq update --dataset --storage_billing_model=LOGICAL my_dataset
	         # For physical bytes billing:  bq update --dataset --storage_billing_model=PHYSICAL my_dataset
	   	Use Table Expiration Settings, Optimize Data Storage Format (cloumner format - paqruet. ORC), Use Long-Term Storage Pricing (> 90 days)
	   -- bq query optimization

16. Optimization of query performance in BigQuery?
	   create dataset in region wehere customer operates
	   Use Partitioned Tables and Clustered Tables
	   use avro format to bigquery data load - google rec compressed avro for quick data load
	   preview option, 
	   select columns instead of *, use truncate instead of delete
	   Join pattern larger table join smaller tables, avoid cross join
	   where class first condition in such way that eliminates most data
	   late aggregation
	   Use WITH Clauses for Subquery Caching (Avoid Repeated Scalar Subqueries)
	   Take Advantage of Query Caching
	   Aggregate Data at the Source: Use Approximate Aggregations: 
	   Create a materialized view based on frequently run queries.
	   Optimize Window Functions
	   Monitor and Tune Query Performance
	   nest repeated data, Denormalize Data Where Appropriate (Use ARRAY Functions for Multi-Value Fields)

  
17. Cost Controls: 
	   budget alerts, Set query usage limits in IAM quotas, Billing reports, Schedule queries during off-peak hours

18. Explain about data modelling concepts( Star and snowflake schema)? 
	Star Schema: Faster query performance due to fewer joins.
	Snowflake Schema: More normalized and reduces data redundancy. May require more joins, potentially impacting query performance.

19. Explain about SCD types? 


21.How to get metadata of datasets and tables in BigQuery? 	
	to get metadata about datasets:  SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`region-europe-west2`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;
	to get metadata about tables: SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`dataset_id`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
	to get metadata about columns: SELECT * FROM `project_id`.`dataset_id`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS;


1. To find the department names where no employees are found, you can use the following SQL query:
   emp -->> employee_id	employee_name	dept_id
   Department Table -->> dept_id	dept_name
   SELECT d.dept_name FROM dept d LEFT JOIN employee e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id WHERE e.dept_id IS NULL;

      )
      WHERE row_num = 777

7. Bigquery arch
   storage and compute - decoupled/isolated (cost efficient)
   layers:
   colossus - is google distributed file system storage layer in column orientaed - fault tolerance by data replicas across different machines.
   dremel - is compute engine - have root server (co-ordinate mixers & leaf nodes) / mixers (do aggreagtions) / leaf nodes (read data from storage)
   jupiter- high speed n/w connector - to connect dremel with colossus
   borg - scheduling jobs like run queries

8. Identify customers who placed orders in consecutive months.
	cust, order_date, order

           SELECT customer_id, DATE_TRUNC(order_date, MONTH) AS order_month FROM `your_dataset.your_table`),
         consecutive_orders AS (
           SELECT customer_id, order_month, LEAD(order_month) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_month) AS next_order_month FROM orders)

         ON  d.doctor_id = p.doctor_id GROUP BY d.doctor_id

10. Handling NULL values in employee salary using the average salary.
    IFNULL(expression, replacement_value) -->> It takes two arguments. If the first argument is NULL, it returns the second argument.
    COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN) -->> It can take multiple arguments. It returns the first non-NULL argument from the list.
         WITH avg_salary AS (
           SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary  FROM `your_dataset.your_table`)
         SELECT employee_id,  COALESCE(salary, (SELECT average_salary FROM avg_salary)) AS adjusted_salary  FROM `your_dataset.your_table`

11. Difference between Subquery and Materialized Views.
    Performance: Materialized views can improve query performance by storing precomputed results, while subqueries are recalculated each time the main query runs.
    Storage: Materialized views consume storage space to store the precomputed results, whereas subqueries do not.
    Maintenance: Materialized views need to be refreshed to stay up-to-date with the underlying data, while subqueries always reflect the current state of the data.

12. CTE vs Subquery in SQL and their performance impact.
    Readability and Maintainability:
    Optimization: Subquery Treated similarly to CTEs in terms of optimization. The query optimizer will attempt to optimize the entire query, including the subqueries.
    Reusability:

13. Change Data Capture (CDC) -->> identify and capture changes made to data in a database --> It helps keep track of inserts, updates, and deletes in real-time.
      Benefits:
      Real-time updates: Ensures data consistency across systems.
      Efficiency: Reduces the need for full data scans.
      Accuracy: Minimizes errors by capturing changes as they happen.
      how to implement:
      log based --> very efficient, no impact on source system
      query based on timestamp
      triggers load changes into new tables
