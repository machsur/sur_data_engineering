>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos:  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common

>> Bash Script structure:
    shebang line - tell to shell what type of script running like bash, py, etc
    commands
    exit statement - 0 successful; 1-255 unsuccessful
    chmod + to give executable permissions for script

    script more professional: comments (#) / Author: / Date Created / Date Modified / Description / Usage
