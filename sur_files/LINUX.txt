>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos:  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common

>> Bash Script structure:
    shebang line - tell to shell what type of script running like bash, py, etc
    commands
    exit statement - 0 successful; 1-255 unsuccessful
    chmod + to give executable permissions for script

    script more professional: comments (#) / Author: / Date Created / Date Modified / Description / Usage

>> 
-- sudo su - , useradd - seshuu , passwd seshuu, su - seshuu , sudo apt install ncal
-- nproc, cal 2023, cat /etc/shells, echo $SHELL
-- touch FN, vi/vim/nano FN
-- execute script: bash script_name, script_name (once user has X permission) 
-- convert shell script onto bash script (shebang) -- #!/bin/bash (in first line of script)
-- editing path variable (./hello.py - hello.py works now) --- echo $PATH, export PATH=$PATH:/home/surmacha/scripts
-- adding comments #
-- variables: 
	make script generic & dynamic 
	datatype is blind/untyped, 
	constant variable (cant reassign later ex-PI) - readonly PI=3.1452
	command substution -- today=$(command) or `command` -- echo $today
