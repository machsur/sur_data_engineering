>> WinSCP (Windows Secure Copy) is a popular open-source SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), 
    and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client for Windows. 
    It provides a graphical interface for securely transferring files between a local computer and a remote server.

==================
>> CMD vs GIT BASH - command-line interfaces for intract with OS.
    CMD - executing Windows commands, 
    Git Bash - supports Unix commands and Git functionalities, windows commands too.

>> GitHub is a platform for hosting and managing code. It’s built on top of Git
    GitHub helps developers storing code, VCS, collaborate, track changes, and manage software projects effectively.

>> GIT: distributed version control system
    local VCS - my machine - i want to collaborate with others - system crashes
    centralized VCS - server repo / working copy - copy on server and current version on user machine
    distributed VCS - server repo / repository /  working copy 
    Working directory  ---> .git local repository (stagging area and commit history)---> git remote repository (when         
      collaborate with team)

======================    
>> Control-M: scheduling tool in HSBC on-prim env
    -- deploy control-m jobs (XML file) on control-m server via digBA portal using CR in production
    -- control-m server sends instructions to control-m agent installed on win/linux to run the script at scheduled time.

======================
DB concepts:
>> Constraint - rule applied to a column or table to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of the data.
  ✔ Accuracy: Data should be correct and valid (e.g., no negative ages).
  ✔ Consistency: Data follows rules (e.g., employees must belong to existing departments).
  ✔ Integrity: Data relationships are protected (e.g., prevent deleting a department with employees).
  PRIMARY KEY	Ensures each value in a column is unique and not NULL --	PRIMARY KEY (ID)
  FOREIGN KEY	Links two tables --✅ DEPTNO in EMPLOYEE must exist in DEPARTMENT, preventing orphan records. --	FOREIGN KEY (DEPTNO) REFERENCES DEPT(DEPTNO)
  NOT NULL	Prevents NULL values in a column.	-- NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  UNIQUE	Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.	-- UNIQUE (EMAIL)
  CHECK	Restricts values based on a condition.	-- CHECK (AGE >= 18)
  DEFAULT	Assigns a default value if no value is provided.--	STATUS VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'Active'

==========================
>> Why linux rather than winndows, macos
  open source & free to use, multi-users work on shared system , good security (no antivirus req), stable and reliable

>> Architexture
  Hardware
  Software
  kernel - to connect hardware and software app - middle man
  shell - instructions are given ro kernel by user via shell
  deamons - run in background 

>> deamon files ends with "d" / data files / configuration files

>> user --> give commands on terminal --> shell(program/CLI) interprets and executes/passes them on --> OS
  type of shell: bash, etc.
  why bash shell: feature-rich, fast, very common
  shell script: file consists series of commands for shell - allow automation, save time, more productive

>> Bash Script structure:
    shebang line - tell to shell what type of script running like bash, py, etc
    commands
    exit statement - 0 successful; 1-255 unsuccessful
    chmod + to give executable permissions for script
