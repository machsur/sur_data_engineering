>> Cloud Composer: Apache airflow version in GCP for workflow (series of task) orchestration
   A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Apache Airflow - is like workflow that tells Airflow what tasks to run, when to run them, and in what order.
   Apache airflow operators guide: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/index.html

-- create composer environment: runs on GKE
    enable api, env_name, location, image version (cloud composer and airflow), Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension role to the service account
    enivronment (schedular, triggerrer, web server, worker), network, bucket, cmek, ...

-- Architexture of composer: Dags dir in gcs - each dag associated schedule with it - based on schedule, scheduler will trigger the dags - 
   the Executor within scheduler, runs dag on worker nodes, metadata db stores info, Web server (for airflow UI)

-- setup local vs code env and install required dependcies (pip install apache-airflow==2.3.3, pip install apache-airflow-providers-google)
    use gcloud commands to intract with cloud composer env
    deploy airflow dag into composer env by placing into gcs dags folder


-- Advantage of cloud composer:
   | DB -- via python --> datalake (gcs) | --> File coneverter csv to parquet --> tarnsform --> load into BQ |
   | py app                             |       dataproc workflow                                            |
   |              cloud composer                                                                              |

>> dag constructor/class - with in dag id, default args, keyword args, tasks are created by instntiating operators - it helps to create dag object
    note: multiple dags in one py script / one dag can spans multiple py scripts
    Dags, task, operator (execute task at its scheduled time), sensor(pause task until specified condition mets ex: file arrives, record update)
    Calling bash/py script in different folder / machine by using connections

>> templating in Airflow : use templating to inject dynamic values (like macros and parameters) into your bash commands in Airflow.
      https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.13/macros-ref.html#


>> install packages in a Cloud Composer environment:
   UI
   gcloud composer environments update my-composer-env --location us-central1 --update-pypi-packages-from-file requirements.txt or --update-pypi-packages=pandas==1.3.3

>> variables - key value pairs - stroes airflow metadata db - adv: avoid hardcoding, reusebility, flexibility, efficiency
   -- my_var = Variable.get("my_variable")
   -- my_var = Variable.get("non_existent_variable", default_var="Default Value")
   -- Key: config & Value: {"retry_count": 3, "email": "admin@example.com"} / config = json.loads(Variable.get("config")) /       print(config["retry_count"])  # Output: 3
   -- If you use Jinja in an Airflow task, you can access variables like {{ var.value.var_key }}

>> why connection: CC connects with external machines usinng ssh and run the scripts.
      in gcp - create custom connection for bq,gcs in cc - composer sa, download json key, place it in gcs, use gcs path - assign roles to sa

   XCom (Cross-communication) - for passing small pieces of data between tasks - making workflows more dynamic and flexible
   branching -  allows you to control the execution path of a workflow based on certain conditions - BranchPythonOperator 
   Subdag : consists group of parellel tasks.
   SLA (Service Level Agreement) - 
      - is a time-based contract specifying how long a task or DAG should take to run. 
      - If a task exceeds this time limit, Airflow will trigger an alert to notify that the SLA has been missed.

>>
   Apache Airflow with Kubernetes allows for a scalable and flexible infrastructure, integrating the dynamic orchestration power of Airflow with the container management       capabilities of Kubernetes. This integration provides benefits like dynamic resource allocation, auto-scaling, and isolated task execution in containers. There are two       primary ways Kubernetes can be integrated with Airflow:
   --   Kubernetes Executor: Airflow tasks are dynamically launched in Kubernetes pods.
   --   KubernetesPodOperator: Individual tasks are run inside Kubernetes pods, but Airflow is otherwise deployed with a different executor.

>> Sensors continuously check (or "poke") to see if a condition has been met. 
      Once the condition is satisfied, the sensor task succeeds, allowing the next task in the workflow to execute. 
      If the condition is not met within the defined timeout period, the sensor fails.

   Types of Sensors
   FileSensor: Waits for a file to appear in a directory.
   ExternalTaskSensor: Waits for another task in a different DAG to complete.
   HttpSensor: Waits for an HTTP endpoint to return a certain response.
   S3/GCSKeySensor: Waits for a file to appear in an S3 bucket.
   TimeSensor: Waits until a specific time of day.

>> Apache Airflow vs beam vs spark
   Airflow: schedule and monitor workflows
   Beam: data processing pipeline (google has cloud dataflow)
   Spark: fast and general processing engine compatible with hadoop eco system. (Dataproc in Google)
