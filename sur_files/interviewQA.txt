Python is the go-to language for data engineering, but it comes with hidden traps! Here’s how to crush them:
🔹 𝟭. 𝗜𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀
❌ Using for loops on millions of records.
✅ Use vectorized operations with Pandas (df.apply(), df.groupby()), or leverage PySpark for big data.
🔹 𝟮. 𝗠𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘀
❌ Keeping huge DataFrames in memory.
✅ Use chunking (pd.read_csv(chunksize=10000)) or Dask for parallel processing.
🔹 𝟯. 𝗠𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗔𝗿𝗴𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀
❌ Defining functions like def my_func(data=[]): (mutable lists persist across calls!)
✅ Use None instead: def my_func(data=None): data = data or [].
🔹 𝟰. 𝗜𝗴𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀
❌ Assuming everything will work smoothly.
✅ Use try-except, logging, and monitoring tools like Airflow & Datadog.
🔹 𝟱. 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗺 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
❌ Using Python’s multiprocessing in distributed environments (doesn't work well with Spark!).
✅ Use Spark, Dask, or Ray for true parallel execution across clusters.
🔹 𝟲. 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻
❌ Writing inefficient SQL queries inside Python (pandas.read_sql()).
✅ Use EXPLAIN plans, indexing, and Snowflake’s query optimization.
🔹 𝟳. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗕𝗶𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮
❌ Pandas struggles with GBs/TBs of data.
✅ Use PySpark, Dask, or DuckDB instead for scalability.
🔹 𝟴. 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀
❌ Storing database credentials directly in code.
✅ Use environment variables, .env files, or secrets management tools.
🔹 𝟵. 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗛𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 & 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴
❌ Writing messy, unstructured code.
✅ Use mypy for type checking, Black for formatting, and pylint for better code quality.
🔹 𝟭𝟬. 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴
❌ Debugging with print() statements.
✅ Use logging module, centralized logging (like ELK, Datadog), and structured logs for debugging.

>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions

>> What is a docstring in Python?
    special kind of comment used to document what a function, class, or module does. 
    appears right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. 
    Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.
>> What is pass in Python? When is it used?
    Placeholder for future class/function/loop definition
    It does nothing when executed 
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why?
    In Python, lists generally occupy more memory than tuples. 
    This is because lists are mutable, meaning their size and contents can change, while tuples are immutable, meaning their size and contents are fixed once created.
