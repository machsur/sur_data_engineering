python:
>> Given an array, find the minimum and maximum values.
    ans. builtin mtds, sorting, python code
>> Given a string, count the char occurrences of word in a dictionary:
    Input: 'aaabbbccddeeeee'
    Output: { “a” : 3 , “b” : 3, “c” : 2, “d” : 2 , “e” : 5 }
>> Write a Python script to count the frequency of characters in a text file.
>> Write a Python program to count the frequency of an word in a text file.
>> Reversing a String using an Extended Slicing techniques. builtin / slicing / code
>> Count Vowels from Given words .
>> Find the highest occurrences of each word from string and sort them in order.
>> Remove Duplicates from List.
>> Sort a List without using Sort keyword.
>> Find the pair of numbers in this list whose sum is n no.
>> Find the max and min no in the list without using inbuilt functions.
>> Read and print values from an Excel file using Pandas.
    df = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx')
>> Handle file exceptions (missing or corrupted Excel files) gracefully.
>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions

>> What is a docstring in Python?
    special kind of comment used to document what a function, class, or module does. 
    appears right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. 
    Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.
>> What is pass in Python? When is it used?
    Placeholder for future class/function/loop definition
    It does nothing when executed 
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why?
    In Python, lists generally occupy more memory than tuples. 
    This is because lists are mutable, meaning their size and contents can change, while tuples are immutable, meaning their size and contents are fixed once created.


Write a Python script to create a palindrome with a given number of alphabets.
    Example: For n=3 (alphabets: a, b, c) → Palindrome: abcba
>> Write Python code to make API requests to a public API (e.g., weather API) and process the JSON response.
>> Implement a function to fetch data from a database table, perform data manipulation, and update the database.

SQL QA:
>> Given two tables, find the count of records for Left Outer Join and Inner Join:
Table A: Table B:
1 1
1 1
1 1 
1 
Ans. 12 & 12
>> Give the output for DENSE_RANK() and RANK() functions for the below dataset:
Nums 
85 
85 
80 
75 
75 
70

>> Given a table with column 'Country', select data in the below sequence:
Table: Matches
Country 
India 
Australia 
Pakistan 
Output:
India vs Australia 
India vs Pakistan 
Australia vs Pakistan
Ans. 
    SELECT a.countryc || ' vs ' || b.countryc as country
    FROM
      `powerful-layout-445408-p5.sur_test_ds.countryt` a
    join
      `powerful-layout-445408-p5.sur_test_ds.countryt` b
    on a.countryc > b.countryc;  -----> or <
>> Given two tables, output the result of INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL JOINS.
Table1:
col1 
---- 
1 
1 
Table2:
---- 
b 
a

>> Find the 777th highest salary from a table.
🔹 Identify customers who placed orders in consecutive months.
🔹 Query to get the total number of patients per doctor, including unassigned patients.
>> Handling NULL values in employee salary using the average salary.
    IFNULL(expression, replacement_value) -->> It takes two arguments. If the first argument is NULL, it returns the second argument.
    COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN) -->> It can take multiple arguments. It returns the first non-NULL argument from the list.
>> Difference between Subquery and Materialized Views.
    Performance: Materialized views can improve query performance by storing precomputed results, while subqueries are recalculated each time the main query runs.
    Storage: Materialized views consume storage space to store the precomputed results, whereas subqueries do not.
    Maintenance: Materialized views need to be refreshed to stay up-to-date with the underlying data, while subqueries always reflect the current state of the data.
>> CTE vs Subquery in SQL and their performance impact.
    Readability and Maintainability:
    Optimization: Subquery Treated similarly to CTEs in terms of optimization. The query optimizer will attempt to optimize the entire query, including the subqueries.
    Reusability:
🔹 Steps to debug a slow SQL query.
