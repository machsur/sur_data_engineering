🎇 Differences between Apache spark & Pyspark:
📗 PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling Python programmers to take advantage of Spark’s distributed data processing capabilities. It is build on the same core of Apache spark.
📗 Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It supports batch processing, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

1️⃣ Language
Apache spark which is written in scala needs knowledge of java and scala to work.
Pyspark offers the functionalities in python language.

2️⃣ Performance
Spark when performed with scala does the optimal execution and more execution speed than pyspark.
Pyspark has some overhead due to interaction between JVM and eventually python & slower performance than spark.

3️⃣ Data processing
Spark functionality revolves around its data processing engine, which can handle batch and real-time data processing at scale.
PySpark provides an API for data processing, enabling operations such as filtering, aggregating, and joining datasets in a distributed manner. It simplifies the development of data pipelines by allowing these tasks to be defined in Python code.

4️⃣ Data ingestion
Spark supports data ingestion across a range of sources. Its built-in connectors and APIs enable direct access to storage systems, databases, and streaming sources. 
PySpark simplifies the process of data ingestion from various sources, including HDFS, Kafka, and cloud storage services like AWS S3.

5️⃣ Deployment
Spark’s deployment capabilities are equally versatile, supporting a range of cluster managers and cloud platforms. 
PySpark applications benefit from the ease of deployment inherent to Python scripts, allowing integration with CI/CD pipelines and containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.
