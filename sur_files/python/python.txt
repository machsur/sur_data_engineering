>> BigO
	time complexity: code1 - 15 sec < code2-60sec, means code1 is better than code2 / different machine time varies / so, we measure in terms of no of operations
	Space complexity: code1 15sec but larger space and code2 60sec lesser space, here code2 is better if we concern about space.

>> omega (best case), theta (avg case), omecron (bigO-worst case)	
	O(1) - const oper even n varies
	O(logn) - 2^3 = 8 / log8=3 / divide two parts
	O(n) - for loop
	O(nlogn) - some sorting algortiums
	O(n2) - nested for loop
	for different inputs - O(a+b) - O(a*b)

Python:
>> Interpreter: The programme that runs your code.
   Virtual Environment: A separate "workspace" that uses a Python interpreter but has its own packages and dependencies.
>> pip - tool for install python packages
   pypi - centralized repository for py packages
>> terminate the python programme  ---> sys.exit()
   execute the file using the specified program or interpreter (#!/usr/bin/python3.5)
>> set path in windows & help('LISTS')
>> variables, lists, tuple, set, dictionory
>> Datatypes: None, Numeric (int, float, bool, complex), sequence(list, tuple, set, range, string), mapping(dictinory)
>> operators: arthematic: +  comparision: ==   logical: and or not   identify: x is y    membership:  x in y  
>> swap variables
>> user input: input / int / eval / python file.py 6(sys.argv[1]) 2 /
>> if elif else / while loop / for loop / for else / break continue pass /
>> why arrays than lists: Optimized/faster, memory efficient for mathematical operations for numerical data.
   Why NumPy: to work with multi-dimensional arrays 
   why Pandas:  handle tabulaer data - data scientist life easier and effective (Python - Need to write code, Excel - Can not handle large data)
>> functions: positional / keyworded / variable length: def sum(a, *b): / keyword variable length: def person(name, **data) /Global variable & local variable  
   recursion: function calling it self ex: factorial using recurssion
   anonymous function, short, one-line function: lambda -- map, filter, reduce
   List comprehensation: create new list from existiong list or other iterals
>> decorator: adding extra feature to the existing function without touching them.
>> Special variable: __name__ == __main__
>> OOPS: Class, object, constructer (__init__), self, variables: instance & class var, metd: instance & class & static mtd,  inner class
   inheritance: single level & multi level & multiple,  constructor in inheritance: super().__init__/mtd | MRO
   polymorphisum: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading: NA (achive by a=None), method overriding: child class method overrides parent class mtd 
>> Encaptulation: 
	public variable: can access outside class
	private variable: cannt acces from outside of class
	protected variable: can access from derived class, other not
>> Abstract class & method
>> iterators: 
 
>> Handlling errors: using the try-except block --> any error in the try block, exception will be raised and it caught by except block
   compile time error: Syntatical, Logical error: wrong output - used * instead of +, run time error:  occur while the program is running --- print(5 / 0) 
>> multi threading: You're doing multiple tasks at once — that's what multithreading is in a program.
>> file handling, Comments
>> library (group of packages) --> Package (folder - collection of modules) ---> module (file1.py)
>> Why Logging Instead Print: Levels, Output Options, format, Production-Ready.
>> file operations:
-- Magic/Tunder/double underscore methods: enable you to define the behavour of objects for built-in operations such as arth ope, comp oper, more

>> Hiding Passwords in Environment Variables ---> set SECRET_KEY="my$ecretP@ssw0rd" ---> secret_key = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
>> Config Files --->  config.read('config.ini')  ---> db_host = config['database']['host']

>> Given an array, find the minimum and maximum values:    ans. builtin mtds, sorting, python code
>> Given a string, count the char occurrences of word in a dictionary:    Input: 'aaabbbccddeeeee'
>> Count Vowels from Given words .
>> find line_count, words, chars in the files
>> Write a Python script to count the frequency of characters/words in a text file.  --------> using for loop /from collections import Counter
>> Reversing a String using an Extended Slicing techniques. -------> builtin / slicing / code
>> Find the highest occurrences of each word from string and sort them in order.
>> Remove Duplicates from List. set / for loop / list comprehension 
>> Sort a List without using Sort keyword. built-in / bubble sort /
>> Find the pair of numbers in this list whose sum is n no.
>> Read and print values from an Excel file using Pandas.
>> Handle file exceptions (missing or corrupted Excel files) gracefully. no error in try block --> try - else - finally /// error ---> except - finally
>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions:      print(set(ls1) & set(ls2)) or lss =[item for item in ls1 if item in ls2]
>> What is a docstring in Python?  Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.
>> What is pass in Python? When is it used? --> Placeholder for future class/function / It does nothing when executed 
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why? --> lists occupy more memory --> their size and contents can change, more methods
	print(sys.getsizeof(list_obj))   # e.g., 120 bytes
>>  Given a list [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], how can you sum all elements? (Discuss available functions)
>>  What is a constructor? -> is special method (__init__) and automatically called to initilize variables when a new instance of a class is created.
>> Find out common letters between two strings Using Python
>> convert two list into dict: result = dict(zip(keys, values))  	// 	convert dict into tuple:     result = tuple(my_dict.items())

>> Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
>> Factorial
>> shallow & deep copy - way to duplicate lists etc - behave diff for nested structures (like lists inside lists) - Affects original & original safe when nested changed
>> List Comprehension: [x for x in ls if x % 3 == 0]  //  ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]  //
   [p['name'] for p in people if p['age'] > 30]      //   unique_words = list({word.lower() for word in "Hello world hello".split()})
>> Create dictionary from two lists: result_dict = {k: v for k, v in zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])}
>> *args and **kwargs: Allows function to accept any number of positional arguments (tuple) & any number of keyword arguments (dict)
