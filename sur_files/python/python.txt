>> BigO
	time complexity: code1 - 15 sec < code2-60sec, means code1 is better than code2 / different machine time varies / so, we measure in terms of no of operations
	Space complexity: code1 15sec but larger space and code2 60sec lesser space, here code2 is better if we concern about space.

>> omega (best case), theta (avg case), omecron (bigO-worst case)	
	O(1) - const oper even n varies
	O(logn) - 2^3 = 8 / log8=3 / divide two parts
	O(n) - for loop
	O(nlogn) - some sorting algortiums
	O(n2) - nested for loop
	for different inputs - O(a+b) - O(a*b)

Python:
>> Interpreter: The programme that runs your code.
>> Virtual Environment: Python interpreter + dependencies  - Keeps dependencies isolated from other projects
	python -m venv myenv	/ 	venv\Scripts\activate	/	pip install <package-name>	/	deactivate	/
>> pip - tool for install python packages
>> pypi - centralized repository for py packages
>> terminate the python programme  ---> sys.exit()
>> Shebang: #!/usr/bin/python3.5  -  tells the operating system which interpreter to use to run the file. 
>> set path in windows: allows to run script from cmd
   hide passwords in Windows and access them securely from Python, you can use environment variables or more secure options like the Windows Credential Manager   
   Config Files: great way to manage settings (API keys,..) separately from your main Python code.
>> variables, lists, tuple, set, dictionory
>> Datatypes: None, Numeric (int, float, bool, complex), sequence(list, tuple, set, range, string), mapping(dictinory)
>> operators: arthematic: +  comparision: ==   logical: and or not   identify: x is y    membership:  x in y  
>> swap variables
>> user input: input / int / eval / python file.py 6(sys.argv[1]) 2 /
>> if elif else / while loop / for loop / for else / break continue pass /
>> why arrays than lists: Optimized/faster, memory efficient for mathematical operations for numerical data.
   Why NumPy: to work with multi-dimensional arrays 
   why Pandas:  handle tabulaer data - data scientist life easier and effective (Python - Need to write code, Excel - Can not handle large data)
>> functions: positional / keyworded / variable length: def sum(a, *b): / keyword variable length: def person(name, **data) /Global variable & local variable  
   recursion: function calling it self ex: factorial using recurssion
   anonymous function, short, one-line function: lambda -- map, filter, reduce
   List comprehensation: create new list from existiong list or other iterals
>> decorator: adding extra feature to the existing function without touching them.
>> Special variable: __name__ == __main__
>> OOPS: Class, object, constructer (__init__), self, variables: instance & class var, metd: instance & class & static mtd,  inner class
   inheritance: single level & multi level & multiple,  constructor in inheritance: super().__init__/mtd | MRO
   polymorphisum: Duck typing, operator overloading, method overloading: NA (achive by a=None), method overriding: child class method overrides parent class mtd 
>> Encaptulation: 
	public variable: can access outside class
	private variable: cannt acces from outside of class
	protected variable: can access from derived class, other not
>> Abstract class & method
>> iterators: 
 
>> Handlling errors: using the try-except block --> any error in the try block, exception will be raised and it caught by except block
   compile time error: Syntatical, Logical error: wrong output - used * instead of +, run time error:  occur while the program is running --- print(5 / 0) 
>> multi threading: You're doing multiple tasks at once — that's what multithreading is in a program.
>> file handling, Comments
>> library (group of packages) --> Package (folder - collection of modules) ---> module (file1.py)
>> Why Logging Instead Print: Levels, Output Options, format, Production-Ready.
>> file operations:
-- Magic/Tunder/double underscore methods: enable you to define the behavour of objects for built-in operations such as arth ope, comp oper, more

>> find student details corresponding to max_marks:    student = [('suresh', 'ong', 85), ('seshu', 'bng', 74), ('naven', 'kk', 40)]
>> Given an array, find the minimum and maximum values:    ans. builtin mtds, sorting, python code
>> Given a string, count the char occurrences of word in a dictionary:    Input: 'aaabbbccddeeeee'
>> Count Vowels from Given words .
>> find line_count, words, chars in the files
>> Write a Python script to count the frequency of characters/words in a text file.  
>> Reversing a String using an Extended Slicing techniques. -------> builtin / slicing / code
>> Find the highest occurrences of each word from string and sort them in order.
>> Remove Duplicates from List. 
>> Sort a List without using Sort keyword. built-in / bubble sort /
>> Find the pair of numbers in this list whose sum is n no.
>> Read and print values from an Excel file using Pandas.
>> Handle file exceptions (missing or corrupted Excel files) gracefully. no error in try block --> try - else - finally /// error ---> except - finally
>> Calculate the Intersection of Two Lists without using Built-in Functions:      print(set(ls1) & set(ls2)) or lss =[item for item in ls1 if item in ls2]
>> What is a docstring in Python?  Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines.
>> What is pass in Python? When is it used? --> Placeholder for future class/function / It does nothing when executed 
>> Which data structure occupies more memory: list or tuple? Why? --> lists occupy more memory --> their size and contents can change, more methods
	print(sys.getsizeof(list_obj))   # e.g., 120 bytes
>>  Given a list [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], how can you sum all elements? (Discuss available functions)
>>  What is a constructor? -> is special method (__init__) and automatically called to initilize variables when a new instance of a class is created.
>> Find out common letters between two strings Using Python
>> convert two list into dict: result = dict(zip(keys, values))  	// 	convert dict into tuple:     result = tuple(my_dict.items())
>> FIND MISSING NUMBER IN AN ARRAY IN PYTHON  :  n(n+1)/2 - sum(array_elements)

>> PRINT PATTERNS
>> number is prime or not
>> Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
>> Factorial
>> shallow & deep copy - way to duplicate lists etc - behave diff for nested structures (like lists inside lists) - Affects original & original safe when nested changed
>> List Comprehension: [x for x in ls if x % 3 == 0]  //  ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]  //
   [p['name'] for p in people if p['age'] > 30]      //   unique_words = list({word.lower() for word in "Hello world hello".split()})
>> *args and **kwargs: Allows function to accept any number of positional arguments (tuple) & any number of keyword arguments (dict)
>> What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?
>> array contains duplicates - use for in for (n2, 1) - compare element with previous element (n, n)
